A universal Python parser combinator library inspired by Parsec library of
Haskell.

Parser combinator is a technique to implement a parser.A parser combinator is
a function (higher-order function) that accepts several parsers as arguments
and return a new parser as result. Parser combinators enable a recursive descent
parsing strategy, this parsing technique facilitates modular piecewise
construction and testing. Parser combinators can be used to combine basic
parsers to construct parsers for more complex rules, and parser built using
combinators are straightforward to construct, readable, modular, well-structured
and easily maintainable.
